# qMath
 
qMath is an 'Extension' library for providing a fluent interface for various math operations on different C# types.

As of now, its in early stages and i hope i can implement the idea behind it.

## Roadmap

* Extensions methods for all types.
* A Query builder. Basically, build a Math operation by parsing a string or by using Extension methods which returns 'Query' Instance with all the previous + the current operation.
